// CYBER PET
// This program will require the user to select a pet from three options. Once the pet is selected, the user can select a name for it. When the pet is created, the user is taken to a different interface where they can interact with the pet by clicking actions that will increase or decrease the happiness of the pet as well as presenting a message to the user in the DOM.
